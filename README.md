# UFO-s Analysis
## Overview:

In this project JavaScript is utilized to help build and implement a table and search/filter feature to help illustrate data. This is all displayed on a dynamic webpage to help create a nice user experience for those that are researching about UFO-s. 

## Results:
the results are a dynamic webpage that creates a fluid experience for users. They are able to easily see and access information on various encounters all over the world, while also getting a brief synopsis of each encounter. they are able to see the; country, city, duration, shape, date that it occurred as well as a brief comment describing the encounter.
## Summary:
Our goal was to create a webpage using JavaScript to help create a interesting and dynamic experience for users, this was accomplished. However as with any project there is always room for improvement. One of the main drawbacks to this webpage is while it creates an amazing overview of several different experiences it is harder to try and go more in depth with each individual encounter. Perhaps creating an aspect to research further individual encounters would really allow this project to take the next step to becoming a truly essential tool for researchers.
